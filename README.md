# BMI Calculator

## What is it?
At this time I am practicing Python using Mathematical Operations combined with previous module such as String Manipulation, Input Function and Variable Naming. BMI is the Body Mass Index, basically it measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weight the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m).
